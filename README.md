# ScarnesDice
Scarne's Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then:  
&emsp;if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn  
&emsp;if they roll a 2 to 6:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;add the rolled value to their points  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn  
The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
